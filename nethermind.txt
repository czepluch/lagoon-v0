Hello @guidupont @jfrancai, here is the list with the points we discussed previously.
- With the addition of synchronous deposits and burn functionality it is possible to increase the price of shares atomically
- burn function lacks a whenNotPaused modifier - to test
- syncDeposit functionality does not support operators - 
- syncDeposit function does not support referrals - [x]
- syncDeposit function lacks a  whenNotPaused modifier [to test]
- The recent change to the requestDeposit function, where it falls back to synchronous deposits when available, has introduced some inconsistencies::
         - The returned value has a different meaning depending on which execution path is taken.
         - Referral events are not emitted when synchronous deposits are used, even if a referral was provided.
         - Previously, requestDeposit would revert if a pending request already existed. This is now conditional on the availability of synchronous deposits.
