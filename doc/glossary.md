**ERC7540** is smart contract standard for vaults implementing asynchronous deposit and redemption. It is an extension of the erc4626 and erc20 standards.

**Net asset value (NAV)** is the value of a vault that is determined by subtracting its liabilities from its assets. In the erc7540 standard this value is named totalAssets. By dividing the NAV by the totalSupply of shares we get the per-share NAV, or the price per share.
