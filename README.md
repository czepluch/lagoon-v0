# Overview

Welcome to the Lagoon Protocol Documentation! This page serves as a comprehensive introduction to the core concepts, components, and unique features that make Lagoon Protocol a powerful tool for decentralized asset management.

### What is Lagoon Protocol?

Lagoon Protocol is a decentralized asset management platform that enables asset managers to create Lagoon Vaults. These Vaults provide efficient, non-custodial, and risk-managed asset management solutions.

Built on a foundation of smart contract standards, Lagoon Protocol leverages the power of Gnosis Safe, Zodiac Roles Modifier, and other key components to create highly customizable and secure vaults for managing digital assets.

Lagoon Protocol enables the creation of decentralized Vaults (Lagoon Vaults) that support various roles, including Asset Managers, NAV Committees, Vault Creators and Fund Depositors. These Vaults are governed by smart contracts that allow for a wide range of DeFi strategies, from asset management to yield farming, all while maintaining a high level of security and control. The protocol's design prioritizes flexibility, enabling asset manager to configure their Vaults with specific DeFi protocol whitelists, separation of power, fee structures, and more.

### Key Innovations

Lagoon Protocol is built on a robust infrastructure that includes:

* **Gnosis Safe:** Serving as the secure vault for managing assets, ensuring that only authorized parties can execute transactions.
* **ERC-7540**: the asynchronous vault standard, to tokenized share of users, allowing users to deposit assets as underlaying into the vault and received share.
* **Zodiac Roles Modifier:** Provides granular role-based permissions, allowing for detailed governance and access control within each Vault.
* **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** Lagoon Protocol’s architecture, through Gnosis Safe, is designed to support multi-chain strategies, leveraging bridges to manage assets across different blockchain networks.
* **Modular Fees Management:** Allows Vault creators to define, update, or remove performance, management, and entry/exit fees, providing a tailored experience for each Vault.
* **Seamless Integration with Layer 2:** As part of our ongoing commitment to expand the DeFi ecosystem, Lagoon Protocol is fully integrated with Layer 2 compatible with Gnosis Safe, enabling low-cost, high-speed transactions and broadening access to DeFi strategies across multiple chains.

### Why Lagoon Protocol?

Lagoon Protocol is more than just a Vault management system. It represents a significant step forward in the evolution of decentralized finance by providing a flexible, secure, and scalable solution for managing digital assets. Whether you're a sophisticated asset manager, a NAV committee member, or a shareholder looking to optimize your DeFi strategies, Lagoon Protocol offers the tools and infrastructure you need to succeed.

### Who Should Use Lagoon Protocol?

* **Asset Managers** looking to execute sophisticated DeFi strategies with speed of adaptation and full control over asset security.
* **Institutional Investors** who require a secure, transparent, and customizable solution for managing large volumes of digital assets.
* **DeFi Enthusiasts** seeking a platform that supports a wide range of decentralized financial protocols.
